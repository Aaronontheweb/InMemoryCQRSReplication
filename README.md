# Akka.CQRS
Akka.CQRS is a reference architecture for [Akka.NET](https://getakka.net/), intended to illustrate the following Akka.NET techniques and principles:

1. [Command-Query Responsibility Segregation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs) - the Akka.NET actors who consume write events use distinctly different interfaces from those who consume read events
2. [Akka.Cluster](https://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-overview.html) - a module that allows Akka.NET developers to create horizontally scalable, peer-to-peer, fault-tolerant, and elastic networks of Akka.NET actors.
3. [Akka.Cluster.Sharding](https://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-sharding.html) - a fault-tolerant, distributed tool for maintaining a single source of truth for all domain entities. 
4. [Akka.Persistence](https://getakka.net/articles/persistence/event-sourcing.html) - a database-agnostic event-sourcing engine Akka.NET actors can use to persist and recover their data, thereby making it possible to move a persistent entity actor from one node in the cluster to another.
5. [Akka.Persistence.Query](https://getakka.net/articles/persistence/persistence-query.html) - a read-side compliment to Akka.Persistence, Akka.Peristence.Query is able to stream events persisted by the `PersistentActor`s into new views and aggregates.
6. [Akka.Cluster.Tools](https://getakka.net/articles/clustering/distributed-publish-subscribe.html) - this sample makes use of `DistributedPubSub` for publishing events across the different nodes in the cluster and `ClusterSingleton`, to ensure that all read-side entities are up and running at all times.
7. [Petabridge.Cmd](https://cmd.petabridge.com/) - a command-line interface for Akka.NET that we use for watching multiple nodes in the cluster all maintain their own eventually consistent, but independent views of the read-side data produced by Akka.Persistence.Query.
8. [Akka.Bootstrap.Docker](https://github.com/petabridge/akkadotnet-bootstrap/tree/dev/src/Akka.Bootstrap.Docker) - this sample uses Docker and `docker-compose` to run the sample, and Akka.Bootstrap.Docker is used to inject runtime environment variables into the Akka.NET HOCON configuration at run-time.
